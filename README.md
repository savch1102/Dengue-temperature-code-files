# Temperature and Competition: Key Drivers in the Ecological Dynamics of *Aedes* Mosquitoes and Dengue Spread

A repository for R and Python code, scripts and data from the manuscript “Temperature and Competition: Key Drivers in the Ecological Dynamics of *Aedes* Mosquitoes and Dengue Spread”, which explores how temperature influences mosquito population dynamics, species coexistence, and dengue virus transmission in human populations. The study integrates ecological and epidemiological models to evaluate invasion, coexistence, and infection outcomes under different thermal and abundance scenarios.

This work investigates:

+ Temperature-dependent functional traits of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus (biting rate, survival, development, reproduction, mortality).
+ Invasion and coexistence analyses under climate-driven conditions.
+ Impacts of species interactions and temperature on dengue outbreaks in human populations.

The manuscript contributes to the understanding of how climate variability and warming may alter vector ecology and disease risk, providing insights for public health strategies in tropical regions.
